# Arduino-buttons

This library simplifies the use of buttons in Arduino, ESP8266 and ESP-32 projects. It
supports short press-release, long press-release, long press-and-hold and double press
as separate events. There is builtin debouncing to avoid unwanted repeated press events
effectively.


# Usage

To use this library, choose 'Clone or Download' -> 'Zipfile' and store the file on
your computer. In the Arduino IDE, choose the library option and select the Add .ZIP
library option. After that, you should be able to view the examples in the example
section of the Arduino IDE, under 'buttons'.
